##About

Android library that receives video streaming and plays it in an Android device (particularly in a SurfaceView).
The current version of the code only supports RTP over UDP as the transport protocol and decodes H264 encoded video.
As streaming server, we are using libstreaming library with some modifications running in another Android devices.
